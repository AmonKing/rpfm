# Diagnostics Panel

`Diagnostics` panel allows you to quickly identify possible problems in your mod, so you can fix them before they're reflected in-game.

It's pretty simple. You have three filters (Error, Warning and Info), and by default only errors are shown. The panel is updated when opening a PackFile/Editing a PackedFile. And to go to the error, just double-click it and it'll open you the file with the error and scroll down to it.
