# LOC PackedFiles

![Localizable at any hour....](./images/image19.png)

Loc PackedFiles are files that end in `.loc`, and **contain most of the texts you see ingame**. When you open them, you can see they work like aâ€¦ DB Table. They are really an special type of table, so you can do to them exactly the same stuff you do can do to DB Tables. Loc PackedFiles uses the same colour code for cells and rows as the TreeView.
